# RuboCop Comments

> RuboCop was deeply offended that I used 3 double quotes at the beginning and the end of the last string.
> I instead used \n to create new lines. Sorry RuboCop.
> RuboCop also hates the use of + signs to concatenate strings and asked to use \ instead.
> Again, I had to change from double quotes to single quotes on the very last line b/c RuboCop was offended.

# Question

What does \n do within double quotes?

> Adding \n at the end of a string that is enclosed in double quotes will print the next part of the string on a new line.
> This feature can be used to format strings in order to display them over multiple lines instead of one long line.
