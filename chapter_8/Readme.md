# Question

Do you like string interpolation or format strings?  Why?

> I like interpolation better as it is easier to read and interpret.
> However, I can see the use for format strings in the event you want to use a set format
> multiple times.
> Format strings appear similar to dictionaries used in python or a hash in ruby.
