Q.)  Please explain the difference between puts and print in your own words in the Readme.md.

> Puts statements will print out a string on a line. Another puts statement will add the new string to a new line.
> Print statements will add all print statements on to a single line unless I add \n at the end of the string.
> If I were to use puts statements for all the 'end' variables, they would be listed on top of each other.

Study Drills.

1. Go back through and write a comment on what each line does.
2. Read each one backward or out loud to find your errors.
3. From now on, when you make mistakes, write down on a piece of paper what kind of mistake you made.
4. When you go to the next exercise, look at the mistakes you have made and try not to make them in this new one.
5. Remember that everyone makes mistakes. Programmers are like magicians who fool everyone into thinking they are perfect 
and never wrong, but it's all an act. They make mistakes all the time.
