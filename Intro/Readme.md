What are the three most essential skills that a beginner programmer needs to know?

> The three most essential skills would be Reading and Writing, Attention to Detail and Spotting Differences.

Please explain these three skills in your own words.

> In order to program, you must be able to accurately read code and be able to efficiently and effectively type code correctly.
> It is also important that I am able to detect when a [ is needed vs a { or when a : is needed instead of a ;.
> Small discrepancies can have a big impact so it is imperitive to pay attention to details.
> Lastly, as time goes on, I will be able to begin spotting differences when looking at two pieces of similar code.
> This skill can allow me to make the proper corrections and further reinforce best coding practices.

Why do you need to not copy and paste?

> Simply copying and pasting is not going to teach me anything. Typing commands/code is much more effective when learning
> the proper syntax and is essential to being able to read, write and interpret code. 

Why is Practice and Persistence important?

> As with learning any new language, the process will be difficult at first. I have to realize that I am going to fail at times and am 
> not going to fully understand each topic right away. However, persistent practice will train
> my brain over time to understand the language. There are going to be times where I do not understand a topic or
> I can't remember the proper syntax, but repeated practice will eventually ingrain the proper syntax or idea in my 
> mind. It's key to keep training myself and not to give up. At some point, a light bulb is going to go off and I will
> finally understand the topic at hand.
