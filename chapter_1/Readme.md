# RuboCop Comments

> RuboCop does not like double quotes unless interpolation is used or other punctuation is necessary.
> For many of the lines, I used single quotes instead of double quotes.
> For lines that needed double quotes within the string, I used single quotes
> For lines that needed single quotes within the string, I used double quotes
> RuboCop also did not like having too many blank spaces after a line. These blank spaces were deleted.

# Study Drill Stuff

> The # sign can be used to make a comment. If I were to add # at the beginning of one of the lines, that line would not print.
> To print just one of the lines in the ex1.rb file, I can add # signs to the beginning of all lines except for one.
> Per RuboCop, I need to add a space after the # sign.
