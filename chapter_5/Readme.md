# RuboCop Comments

> RuboCop was offended because I did not put a 0 in front of the kilogram number.
> RuboCop was offended due to a mismatch with the weight_in_pound variable,
> which was due to a spelling error. It has been fixed.
> RuboCop again was unhappy about the length of some of the lines. Several lines had to be shortened.
> I had to put comments above the line to make RuboCop happy.
